## Project Status

Completed

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to find new oportunities to sell financial products and services.

## The Steps

The analysis was based on SQL data manipulation using structures like JOINS, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, TEMPORARY TABLE and others.

## Conclusion

It was concluded that:

- There are 203 clients that are considered the best ones in terms of getting loans because they have fineshed their contract without any problems.

- In this group (loan best clients), there are around 143 that do not have credit cards yet, therefore it might be an opportunitty to target them.

- There are 5 clients that are considered the worst ones in terms of getting loans who already have credit cards. For those clients, it might be suggested that the credit cards get canceled until the debts are paid off.
